I build 3 models:
1.linear regression(alpha-lr.py)
2.gradient boost regression(gbr.py)
3.sgd regression(sgd.py)

time I devoted into:1>2>3
performance:2>1>3

One way to run codes are entering "python3 [file_name]" in ubuntu.

Folders with value as name are code and its prediction, the value is score on kaggle, realpred.csv is raw prediction, pred.csv is changed to closest valid integer.
